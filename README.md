Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to express my gratitude for considering me for the upcoming project in the banking domain. However, I would like to kindly request a reconsideration of this assignment, as I have recently upskilled myself in areas that align more closely with my long-term career goals and the organizationâ€™s future technology focus.

During my bench period, I dedicated significant time and effort to enhancing my technical skill set, particularly in Cloud Computing and DevOps. I have also obtained a certification in cloud technologies, which I believe positions me better for roles that involve cloud infrastructure, deployment automation, or related areas.

I am eager to contribute to projects where I can apply these newly acquired skills and continue to grow in the cloud and DevOps space. I believe this will not only help me stay aligned with my career aspirations but also allow me to deliver greater value to the organization in the long run.

I am happy to discuss this further and explore any opportunities that may be more aligned with my current competencies and interests.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
